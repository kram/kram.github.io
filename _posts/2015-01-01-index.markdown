## A short example

{% highlight go %}
IO::Println("Hello World!")

age := 100

if age > 90 {
    IO::Println("You're old! :)")
}

// Functions are first-class citizens
get_three := fn() {
    return 3
}

IO::Println(get_three())
{% endhighlight %}

In Kram, everything is a class, that means that you can do stuff like

{% highlight go %}
150.Sqrt()
{% endhighlight %}
## The future of kram

There is a lot of [stuff](https://github.com/kram/kram/labels/Feature) that needs to be implemented before kram is complete. And **you** are very welcome to help! <img src="/assets/general/emoji/ok_hand.png" alt=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" />

An idea of what the language might look like in the future is available at [idea.kr](https://github.com/kram/kram/blob/master/idea.kr).
