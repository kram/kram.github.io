In addition to the already built in types, such as `Map` and `Function`, you can also define your own types. This is done with the `class`-keyword.

~~~go
// Create a new class called "Wizard"
class Wizard {}
~~~

## Class properties

~~~go
class Wizard {
	
	// Create the property "name" of type "String"
	name : String

	// You can also use the assignment operator (:=) to set a default value
	// In this case the type will automatically be set to "Bool"
	killed_voldemort := false

	// When the value is a function ("fn"), it will be treated as a method
	talk := fn() {

		// You can use the values from within the same class Instance with the keyword "self" (see more below)
		IO::Println("My name is ", self.name)
	}
}
~~~

## Instance of a class

To be able to use the class as a value, you need to create a class-instance with the keyword `new`.

~~~go
// A new "Wizard" is created and assigned to "ron"
ron := new Wizard()
	
// Update the wizards name
ron.name := "Ron"

// A call to the method
ron.talk()
~~~

This code together with the class definition above will print

~~~
My name is Ron
~~~

## Multiple instances

You can have multiple instances of the same class if you want, and each class will get it's own copy of all methods and values

~~~go
ron := new Wizard()
harry := new Wizard()

ron.name := "Ron"
harry.name := "Harry"

ron.talk()
harry.talk()
~~~

The result would be:

~~~
My name is Ron
My name is Harry
~~~
