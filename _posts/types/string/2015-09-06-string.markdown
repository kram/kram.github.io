`String`s are a piece of UTF-8 text, and they are defined by the usage of double quotes (`"`).

~~~go
var hello = "World"
~~~

## Escaping

You can use `\` to escape the following characters

* `\n` - Newline
* `\r` - Return
* `\t` - Tab
* `\\` - Backslash (`\`)
* `\"` - Double qoute (`")

## Methods

*Methods will be added when needed, see https://golang.org/pkg/strings/ for ideas.*
